# Data-Structures-Culmination-Game
Game created as the final project for my CS367: Introduction to Data Structures class. In it, the player will move throughout a house, picking up items necessary to open doors and view other rooms. The player wins the game by collecting a winning item, and bringing this winning item to the winning room.
